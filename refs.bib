Therefore, uncovering neural representations of hippocampal ensemble spike activity during various behavioral states would provide improved understanding of neural mechanisms of hippocampal-cortical circuits. In this paper, we propose two Bayesian nonparametric methods for this purpose: the Bayesian modeling allows to impose informative priors and constraints into the model, whereas Bayesian nonparametrics allows automatic model selection. We validate these methods to three different hippocampal ensemble recordings under different task behaviors, and provide interpretation and discussion on the derived results.},

Spatial activity in the hippocampus is relatively disorganized during the initial exploration of a novel environment, however, and it is unclear how neural activity during the initial stages of learning drives synaptic plasticity. Here we show that pairs of CA1 cells that represent overlapping novel locations are initially more coactive and more precisely coordinated than are cells representing overlapping familiar locations. This increased coordination occurrs specifically during brief, high-frequency events (HFEs) in the local field potential that are similar to ripples and is not associated with better coordination of place-specific neural activity outside of HFEs. As novel locations become more familiar, correlations between cell pairs decrease. Thus, hippocampal neural activity during learning has a unique structure that is well suited to induce synaptic plasticity and to allow for rapid storage of new memories.},

Uncovering the internal representation of hippocampal population codes will help understand neural mechanisms of the hippocampus. For instance, uncovering the patterns represented by rat hippocampus (CA1) pyramidal cells during periods of either navigation or sleep has been an active research topic over the past decades. However, previous approaches to analyze or decode firing patterns of population neurons all assume the knowledge of the place fields, which are estimated from training data a priori. The question still remains unclear how can we extract information from population neuronal responses either without a priori knowledge or in the presence of finite sampling constraint. Finding the answer to this question would leverage our ability to examine the population neuronal codes under different experimental conditions. Using rat hippocampus as a model system, we attempt to uncover the hidden ``spatial topology'' represented by the hippocampal population codes. We develop a hidden Markov model (HMM) and a variational Bayesian (VB) inference algorithm to achieve this computational goal, and we apply the analysis to extensive simulation and experimental data. Our empirical results show promising direction for discovering structural patterns of ensemble spike activity during periods of active navigation. This study would also provide useful insights for future exploratory data analysis of population neuronal codes during periods of sleep.},

Here, we describe an automated clustering approach and associated software package that addresses these problems and provides novel cluster quality metrics. We show that our approach has accuracy comparable to or exceeding that achieved using manual or semi-manual techniques with desktop central processing unit (CPU) runtimes faster than acquisition time for up to hundreds of electrodes. Moreover, a single choice of parameters in the algorithm is effective for a variety of electrode geometries and across multiple brain regions. This algorithm has the potential to enable reproducible and automated spike sorting of larger scale recordings than is currently possible.},

  abstract = {In the hippocampus, replay sequences are temporally compressed patterns of neural spiking that resemble patterns that occur when the animal is moving through the environment. Because replay sequences typically occur when the animal is at rest, replay is hypothesized to be part of an internal cognitive process that enables the retrieval of past spatial memories and the planning of future movement. Traditionally, replay sequences have been discovered by identifying sharp wave ripples (SWRs)\textemdash high frequency oscillations that occur in association with replay\textemdash and then looking within SWRs for spatially continuous patterns of neural spiking. This does not fully account for the content or timing of replay sequences, however. Replay sequences do not always co-occur with sharp wave ripples, have more complex dynamics than spatially continuous movement, have different temporal ordering than during movement, and change based on task. In this work, we introduce a hybrid state space framework to describe the richness of replay sequences. We show how defining discrete latent states associated with continuous latent dynamics and point process observations allows us to identify when non-local replay sequences occur, categorize the type of sequence based on their inferred continuous dynamics, and decode the spatial trajectory corresponding to the replay sequence.},

Neither forward nor backward sequences preferentially represented highly experienced trajectories within a session. Additionally, we observed the construction of never-experienced novel-path sequences. These observations challenge the idea that sequence activation during SWRs is a simple replay of recent experience. Instead, replay reflected all physically available trajectories within the environment, suggesting a potential role in active learning and maintenance of the cognitive map.},

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Further, we found that the underlying dynamics of cycling (both inter- and intra-cycle dynamics) generalized across qualitatively different representational correlates (location and direction). Notably, cycling occurred across moving behaviors, including during running. These findings identify a general dynamic process capable of quickly and continually representing hypothetical experience, including that of multiple possible futures.},

Starting with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into efficient machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language. In addition, we share our experience in building a JIT compiler using LLVM[1].},

A novel combinatorial decoding method reveals that these neurons repeatedly fired in precisely this order in long sequences involving four or more cells during slow wave sleep (SWS) immediately following, but not preceding, the experience. The SWS sequences occurred intermittently in brief (ف100 ms) bursts, each compressing the behavioral sequence in time by approximately 20-fold. This rapid encoding of sequential experience is consistent with evidence that the hippocampus is crucial for spatial learning in rodents and the formation of long-term memories of events in time in humans.},

  abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

  abstract = {Background: Rodent hippocampal population codes represent important spatial information about the environment during navigation. Computational methods have been developed to uncover the neural representation of spatial topology embedded in rodent hippocampal ensemble spike activity. New method: We extend our previous work and propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to infer rat hippocampal population codes during spatial navigation. To tackle the model selection problem, we leverage a Bayesian nonparametric model. Specifically, we apply a hierarchical Dirichlet processhidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) using two Bayesian inference methods, one based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the other based on variational Bayes (VB). Results: The effectiveness of our Bayesian approaches is demonstrated on recordings from a freely behaving rat navigating in an open field environment. Comparison with existing methods: The HDP-HMM outperforms the finite-state HMM in both simulated and experimental data. For HPD-HMM, the MCMC-based inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) hyperparameter sampling is flexible and efficient, and outperforms VB and MCMC approaches with hyperparameters set by empirical Bayes. Conclusion: The Bayesian nonparametric HDP-HMM method can efficiently perform model selection and identify model parameters, which can used for modeling latent-state neuronal population dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Hippocampal activity patterns representing movement trajectories are reactivated in immobility and sleep periods, a process associated with memory recall, consolidation, and decision making. It is thought that only fixed, behaviorally relevant patterns can be reactivated, which are stored across hippocampal synaptic connections. To test whether some generalized rules govern reactivation, we examined trajectory reactivation following non-stereotypical exploration of familiar open-field environments. We found that random trajectories of varying lengths and timescales were reactivated, resembling that of Brownian motion of particles. The animals' behavioral trajectory did not follow Brownian diffusion demonstrating that the exact behavioral experience is not reactivated. Therefore, hippocampal circuits are able to generate random trajectories of any recently active map by following diffusion dynamics. This ability of hippocampal circuits to generate representations of all behavioral outcome combinations, experienced or not, may underlie a wide variety of hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions such as learning, generalization, and planning.},

Neural population analyses often reduce the data dimensionality to focus on relevant activity patterns. A major hurdle to data analysis is spike sorting, and this problem is growing as the number of recorded neurons increases. Here, we investigate whether spike sorting is necessary to estimate neural population dynamics. The theory of random projections suggests that we can accurately estimate the geometry of lowdimensional manifolds from a small number of linear projections of the data. We recorded data using Neuropixels probes in motor cortex of nonhuman primates and reanalyzed data from three previous studies and found that neural dynamics and scientific conclusions are quite similar using multiunit threshold crossings rather than sorted neurons. This finding unlocks existing data for new analyses and informs the design and use of new electrode arrays for laboratory and clinical use.},
