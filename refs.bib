  abstract = {To better understand the functional roles of hippocampal forward and reverse replays, we trained rats in a spatial sequence memory task and examined how these replays are modulated by reward and navigation history. We found that reward enhances both forward and reverse replays during the awake state, but in different ways. Reward enhances the rate of reverse replays, but it increases the fidelity of forward replays for recently traveled as well as other alternative trajectories heading toward a rewarding location. This suggests roles for forward and reverse replays in reinforcing representations for all potential rewarding trajectories. We also found more faithful reactivation of upcoming than already rewarded trajectories in forward replays. This suggests a role for forward replays in preferentially reinforcing representations for high-value trajectories. We propose that hippocampal forward and reverse replays might contribute to constructing a map of potential navigation trajectories and their associated values (a ``value map'') via distinct mechanisms.},

Spatial activity in the hippocampus is relatively disorganized during the initial exploration of a novel environment, however, and it is unclear how neural activity during the initial stages of learning drives synaptic plasticity. Here we show that pairs of CA1 cells that represent overlapping novel locations are initially more coactive and more precisely coordinated than are cells representing overlapping familiar locations. This increased coordination occurrs specifically during brief, high-frequency events (HFEs) in the local field potential that are similar to ripples and is not associated with better coordination of place-specific neural activity outside of HFEs. As novel locations become more familiar, correlations between cell pairs decrease. Thus, hippocampal neural activity during learning has a unique structure that is well suited to induce synaptic plasticity and to allow for rapid storage of new memories.},

Uncovering the internal representation of hippocampal population codes will help understand neural mechanisms of the hippocampus. For instance, uncovering the patterns represented by rat hippocampus (CA1) pyramidal cells during periods of either navigation or sleep has been an active research topic over the past decades. However, previous approaches to analyze or decode firing patterns of population neurons all assume the knowledge of the place fields, which are estimated from training data a priori. The question still remains unclear how can we extract information from population neuronal responses either without a priori knowledge or in the presence of finite sampling constraint. Finding the answer to this question would leverage our ability to examine the population neuronal codes under different experimental conditions. Using rat hippocampus as a model system, we attempt to uncover the hidden ``spatial topology'' represented by the hippocampal population codes. We develop a hidden Markov model (HMM) and a variational Bayesian (VB) inference algorithm to achieve this computational goal, and we apply the analysis to extensive simulation and experimental data. Our empirical results show promising direction for discovering structural patterns of ensemble spike activity during periods of active navigation. This study would also provide useful insights for future exploratory data analysis of population neuronal codes during periods of sleep.},

Here, we describe an automated clustering approach and associated software package that addresses these problems and provides novel cluster quality metrics. We show that our approach has accuracy comparable to or exceeding that achieved using manual or semi-manual techniques with desktop central processing unit (CPU) runtimes faster than acquisition time for up to hundreds of electrodes. Moreover, a single choice of parameters in the algorithm is effective for a variety of electrode geometries and across multiple brain regions. This algorithm has the potential to enable reproducible and automated spike sorting of larger scale recordings than is currently possible.},

Traditionally, these methods assume that multiunit spiking activity has already been correctly spike-sorted. As a result, these methods are not appropriate for situations where sorting cannot be performed with high precision such as real-time decoding for brain-computer interfaces. As the unsupervised spike-sorting problem remains unsolved, we took an alternative approach that takes advantage of recent insights about clusterless decoding. Here we present a new point process decoding algorithm that does not require multiunit signals to be sorted into individual units. We use the theory of marked point processes to construct a function that characterizes the relationship between a covariate of interest (in this case, the location of a rat on a track) and features of the spike waveforms. In our example, we use tetrode recordings, and the marks represent a fourdimensional vector of the maximum amplitudes of the spike waveform on each of the four electrodes. In general, the marks may represent any features of the spike waveform. We then use Bayes' rule to estimate spatial location from hippocampal neural activity.},

  abstract = {In the hippocampus, replay sequences are temporally compressed patterns of neural spiking that resemble patterns that occur when the animal is moving through the environment. Because replay sequences typically occur when the animal is at rest, replay is hypothesized to be part of an internal cognitive process that enables the retrieval of past spatial memories and the planning of future movement. Traditionally, replay sequences have been discovered by identifying sharp wave ripples (SWRs)\textemdash high frequency oscillations that occur in association with replay\textemdash and then looking within SWRs for spatially continuous patterns of neural spiking. This does not fully account for the content or timing of replay sequences, however. Replay sequences do not always co-occur with sharp wave ripples, have more complex dynamics than spatially continuous movement, have different temporal ordering than during movement, and change based on task. In this work, we introduce a hybrid state space framework to describe the richness of replay sequences. We show how defining discrete latent states associated with continuous latent dynamics and point process observations allows us to identify when non-local replay sequences occur, categorize the type of sequence based on their inferred continuous dynamics, and decode the spatial trajectory corresponding to the replay sequence.},

In a linear maze, ordered spatial distances between sequential locations were represented by the temporal relations of hippocampal place cell pairs within cycles of theta oscillation in a compressed manner. Such correlations could arise due to spike ``phase precession'' of independent neurons driven by common theta pacemaker or as a result of temporal coordination among specific hippocampal cell assemblies. We found that temporal correlation between place cell pairs was stronger than predicted by a pacemaker drive of independent neurons, indicating a critical role for synaptic interactions and precise timing within and across cell assemblies in place sequence representation. CA1 and CA3 ensembles, identifying spatial locations, were active preferentially on opposite phases of theta cycles. These observations suggest that interleaving CA3 neuronal sequences bind CA1 assemblies representing overlapping past, present, and future locations into single episodes.},

How is the sequential organization of place cell assemblies maintained across different time scales? Drieu et al. compared periods when a rat either sat passively on a moving train or ran actively on a treadmill on the same train. During the passive movement, the slow behavioral sequence of place cells was still present, but the rapid generation of theta sequences was lost. Active running on the treadmill, however, maintained the theta rhythm. After passive transport, sequence replay during sleep was destroyed, whereas active running protected replay.Science, this issue p. 675Consolidation of spatial and episodic memories is thought to rely on replay of neuronal activity sequences during sleep. However, the network dynamics underlying the initial storage of memories during wakefulness have never been tested. Although slow, behavioral time scale sequences have been claimed to sustain sequential memory formation, fast (``theta'') time scale sequences, nested within slow sequences, could be instrumental. We found that in rats traveling passively on a model train, place cells formed behavioral time scale sequences but theta sequences were degraded, resulting in impaired subsequent sleep replay. In contrast, when the rats actively ran on a treadmill while being transported on the train, place cells generated clear theta sequences and accurate trajectory replay during sleep. Our results support the view that nested sequences underlie the initial formation of memory traces subsequently consolidated during sleep.},

During spatial learning, place-related firing patterns in the CA1, but not CA3, region of the rat hippocampus were reorganized to represent new goal locations. Such reorganization did not occur when goals were marked by visual cues. The stabilization and successful retrieval of these newly-acquired CA1 representations for behaviorally-relevant places was NMDAR-dependent and necessary for subsequent memory retention performance. Goal-related assembly patterns associated with sharp wave/ripple network oscillations, during both learning and subsequent rest periods, predicted memory performance. Together, these results suggest that reorganization and reactivation of assembly firing patterns in the hippocampus represent the formation and expression of new spatial memory traces.},

  abstract = {A central goal in learning and memory research is to reveal the neural substrates underlying episodic memory formation. The hallmark of sequential spatial trajectory learning, a model of episodic memory, has remained equivocal, with proposals ranging from de novo creation of compressed sequential replay from blank slate networks to selection of pre-existing compressed preplay sequences. Here, we show that increased millisecond-timescale activation of cell assemblies expressed during de novo sequential experience and increased neuronal firing rate correlations can explain the difference between postexperience trajectory replay and robust preplay. This increased activation results from an improved neuronal tuning to specific cell assemblies, higher recruitment of experience-tuned neurons into preexisting cell assemblies, and increased recruitment of cell assemblies in replay. In contrast, changes in overall neuronal and cell assembly temporal order within extended sequences do not account for sequential trajectory learning. We propose the coordinated strengthening of cell assemblies played sequentially on robust pre-existing temporal frameworks could support rapid formation of episodiclike memory.},

  abstract = {The activity of individual hippocampal principal neurons is spatially localized such that each neuron is active only when the animal occupies an area of the environment known as the cell's place field. Additionally, the activity of hippocampal neurons exhibits a particular temporal relationship to the hippocampal EEG, such that spikes fired by the neuron occur at progressively earlier phases of the co-occurring theta rhythm in the EEG as the animal traverses the place field. This relationship is known as theta precession. A long-standing prediction following the observation of theta precession has been that among a collection of hippocampal neurons recorded simultaneously, the neurons will fire in sequences reflecting the behavioral order of the place fields. Here we examine this prediction. We show that clear, ordered sequences occur during theta, which we name theta sequences, in which a portion of the animal's spatial experience is played out in forwards order. We further investigate the relationship of theta sequences to phase precession by shuffling spike phases in such a way as to preserve the relationship between spike phase and position. This jitter significantly reduces the prevalence of theta sequences while leaving theta phase precession intact, suggesting that the presence of theta phase precession is not trivially predictive of theta sequences. Finally, we discuss the relationship between theta sequences and individual place fields, and the possible functional role of theta sequences in navigational learning. VC 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We observed forward and backward replay of B even when rats had been performing A for {$>$}10 min. Furthermore, replay of nonlocal sequence B occurred more often when B was infrequently experienced. Neither forward nor backward sequences preferentially represented highly experienced trajectories within a session. Additionally, we observed the construction of never-experienced novel-path sequences. These observations challenge the idea that sequence activation during SWRs is a simple replay of recent experience. Instead, replay reflected all physically available trajectories within the environment, suggesting a potential role in active learning and maintenance of the cognitive map.},

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The fraction of bursts was not reliably higher in place field centers, but rather in places where discharge frequency was 6\textendash 7 Hz. Burst probability was lower and bursts were shorter after recent spiking activity than after prolonged periods of silence (100 ms\textendash 1 s). Burst initiation probability and burst length were correlated with extracellular spike amplitude and with intracellular action potential rising slope. We suggest that bursts may function as ``conditional synchrony detectors,'' signaling strong afferent synchrony after neuronal silence, and that single spikes triggered by a weak input may suppress bursts evoked by a subsequent strong input.},

Recently{$\mkern1mu$}, progress has been made in identifying the hippocampal neural activity patterns that implement these functions. One such pattern is the sharp wave\textendash ripple (SWR), an event associated with highly synchronous neural firing in the hippocampus and modulation of neural activity in distributed brain regions. Hippocampal spiking during SWRs can represent past or potential future experience, and SWR-related interventions can alter subsequent memory performance. These findings and others suggest that SWRs support both memory consolidation and memory retrieval for processes such as decision-making. In addition, studies have identified distinct types of SWR based on representational content, behavioural state and physiological features. These various findings regarding SWRs suggest that different SWR types correspond to different cognitive functions, such as retrieval and consolidation. Here, we introduce another possibility \textemdash{} that a single SWR may support more than one cognitive function. Taking into account classic psychological theories and recent molecular results that suggest that retrieval and consolidation share mechanisms, we propose that the SWR mediates the retrieval of stored representations that can be utilized immediately by downstream circuits in decision-making, planning, recollection and/or imagination while simultaneously initiating memory consolidation processes.},

We simultaneously recorded from hippocampal and mPFC principal neurons in rats performing a mPFC-dependent rule-switching task on a plus maze. We found that mPFC neuronal activity encoded relative positions between the start and goal. During awake immobility periods, the mPFC replayed temporally organized sequences of these generalized positions, resembling entire spatial trajectories. The occurrence of mPFC trajectory replay positively correlated with rule-switching performance. However, hippocampal and mPFC trajectory replay occurred independently, indicating different functions. These results demonstrate that the mPFC can replay ordered activity patterns representing generalized locations and suggest that mPFC replay might have a role in flexible behavior.},

We found neural activity encoding two possible future scenarios (two upcoming maze paths) in constant alternation at 8 Hz: one scenario per \$125-ms cycle. Further, we found that the underlying dynamics of cycling (both inter- and intra-cycle dynamics) generalized across qualitatively different representational correlates (location and direction). Notably, cycling occurred across moving behaviors, including during running.

A novel combinatorial decoding method reveals that these neurons repeatedly fired in precisely this order in long sequences involving four or more cells during slow wave sleep (SWS) immediately following, but not preceding, the experience. The SWS sequences occurred intermittently in brief (ف100 ms) bursts, each compressing the behavioral sequence in time by approximately 20-fold.

  abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

  abstract = {Background: Rodent hippocampal population codes represent important spatial information about the environment during navigation. Computational methods have been developed to uncover the neural representation of spatial topology embedded in rodent hippocampal ensemble spike activity. New method: We extend our previous work and propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to infer rat hippocampal population codes during spatial navigation. To tackle the model selection problem, we leverage a Bayesian nonparametric model. Specifically, we apply a hierarchical Dirichlet processhidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) using two Bayesian inference methods, one based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the other based on variational Bayes (VB). Results: The effectiveness of our Bayesian approaches is demonstrated on recordings from a freely behaving rat navigating in an open field environment. Comparison with existing methods: The HDP-HMM outperforms the finite-state HMM in both simulated and experimental data. For HPD-HMM, the MCMC-based inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) hyperparameter sampling is flexible and efficient, and outperforms VB and MCMC approaches with hyperparameters set by empirical Bayes. Conclusion: The Bayesian nonparametric HDP-HMM method can efficiently perform model selection and identify model parameters, which can used for modeling latent-state neuronal population dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the structure of neural activity during REM sleep, we simultaneously recorded the activity of multiple neurons in the rat hippocampus during both sleep and awake behavior. We show that temporally sequenced ensemble firing rate patterns reflecting tens of seconds to minutes of behavioral experience are reproduced during REM episodes at an equivalent timescale. Furthermore, within such REM episodes behavior-dependent modulation of the subcortically driven theta rhythm is also reproduced. These results demonstrate that long temporal sequences of patterned multineuronal activity suggestive of episodic memory traces are reactivated during REM sleep. Such reactivation may be important for memory processing and provides a basis for the electrophysiological examination of the content of dream states.},

  abstract = {Hippocampal place cells encode an animal's current position in space during exploration [1]. During sleep, hippocampal network activity recapitulates patterns observed during recent experience: place cells with overlapping spatial fields show a greater tendency to co-fire (``reactivation'') [2], and temporally ordered and compressed sequences of place cell firing observed during wakefulness are reinstated (``replay'') [3\textendash 5]. Reactivation and replay may underlie memory consolidation [6\textendash 10]. Compressed sequences of place cell firing also occur during exploration: during each cycle of the theta oscillation, the set of active place cells shifts from those signaling positions behind to those signaling positions ahead of an animal's current location [11, 12]. These ``theta sequences'' have been linked to spatial planning [13]. Here, we demonstrate that, before weaning (post-natal day [P]21), offline place cell activity associated with sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) reflects predominantly stationary locations in recently visited environments. By contrast, sequential place cell firing, describing extended trajectories through space during exploration (theta sequences) and subsequent rest (replay), emerge gradually after weaning in a coordinated fashion, possibly due to a progressive decrease in the threshold for experience-driven plasticity. Hippocampus-dependent learning and memory emerge late in altricial mammals [14\textendash 17], appearing around weaning in rats and slowly maturing thereafter [14,15]. In contrast, spatially localized firing is observed 1 week earlier (with reduced spatial tuning and stability) [18\textendash 21]. By examining the development of hippocampal reactivation, replay, and theta sequences, we show that the coordinated maturation of offline consolidation and online sequence generation parallels the late emergence of hippocampal memory in the rat.},

Yet it remains to be investigated whether these functions are temporally segregated, occurring during different behavioral states. During a self-paced spatial task, awake hippocampal replay occurring either immediately before movement toward a reward location or just after arrival at a reward location preferentially involved cells consistent with the current trajectory. In contrast, during periods of extended immobility, no such biases were evident. Notably, the occurrence of task-focused reactivations predicted the accuracy of subsequent spatial decisions. Additionally, during immobility, but not periods preceding or succeeding movement, grid cells in deep layers of the entorhinal cortex replayed coherently with the hippocampus. Thus, hippocampal reactivations dynamically and abruptly switch between operational modes in response to task demands, plausibly moving from a state favoring navigational planning to one geared toward memory consolidation.},

SPW-Rs are characterized by several spectral components: a slow (5\textendash 15 Hz) sharp-wave, a high-frequency ``ripple'' oscillation (150\textendash 200 Hz), and a slow ``gamma'' oscillation (20\textendash 40 Hz). Using laminar hippocampal recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we dissected the origin of these spectral components. We show that increased power in the 20\textendash 40 Hz band does not reflect an entrainment of CA1 and CA3 neurons at gamma frequency but the power envelope of overlapping ripples. Spike-local field potential coupling between unit firing in CA1 and CA3 regions during SPW-Rs is lowest in the gamma band. Longer SPW-Rs are preceded by increased firing in the entorhinal cortex. Thus, fusion of SPW-Rs leads to lengthening of their duration associated with increased power in the slow gamma band without the presence of true oscillation.},

Deep CA2 neurons gradually increased their activity prior to ripples and were suppressed during the population bursts of CA3-CA1 neurons (ramping cells). Activity of superficial CA2 cells preceded the activity surge in CA3-CA1 (phasic cells). The trigger role of the CA2 region in SPW-R was more pronounced during waking than sleeping.

Hippocampal place cells replay spatial paths during immobility in reverse and forward order, offering a potential mechanism. However, how replay supports both goal-directed learning and memory-guided decision making is unclear. We therefore continuously tracked awake replay in the same hippocampal-prefrontal ensembles throughout learning of a spatial alternation task. We found that, during pauses between behavioral trajectories, reverse and forward hippocampal replay supports an internal cognitive search of available past and future possibilities and exhibits opposing learning gradients for prediction of past and future behavioral paths, respectively. Coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal replay distinguished correct past and future paths from alternative choices, suggesting a role in recall of past paths to guide planning of future decisions for spatial working memory. Our findings reveal a learning shift from hippocampal reverse-replay-based retrospective evaluation to forward-replay-based prospective planning, with prefrontal readout of memory-guided paths for learning and decision making.},

It is thought that only fixed, behaviorally relevant patterns can be reactivated, which are stored across hippocampal synaptic connections. To test whether some generalized rules govern reactivation, we examined trajectory reactivation following non-stereotypical exploration of familiar open-field environments. We found that random trajectories of varying lengths and timescales were reactivated, resembling that of Brownian motion of particles. The animals' behavioral trajectory did not follow Brownian diffusion demonstrating that the exact behavioral experience is not reactivated. Therefore, hippocampal circuits are able to generate random trajectories of any recently active map by following diffusion dynamics. This ability of hippocampal circuits to generate representations of all behavioral outcome combinations, experienced or not, may underlie a wide variety of hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions such as learning, generalization, and planning.},

  abstract = {The mnemonic functions of hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) have been studied extensively. Because hippocampal outputs affect not only cortical but also subcortical targets, we examined the impact of SPW-Rs on the firing patterns of lateral septal (LS) neurons in behaving rats. A large fraction of SPW-Rs were temporally locked to high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (120\textendash 180 Hz) in LS, with strongest coupling during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, followed by waking immobility. However, coherence and spike-local field potential (LFP) coupling between the two structures were low, suggesting that HFOs are generated locally within the LS GABAergic population. This hypothesis was supported by optogenetic induction of HFOs in LS. Spiking of LS neurons was largely independent of the sequential order of spiking in SPW-Rs but instead correlated with the magnitude of excitatory synchrony of the hippocampal output. Thus, LS is strongly activated by SPW-Rs and may convey hippocampal population events to its hypothalamic and brainstem targets.},

  abstract = {A central goal of systems neuroscience is to relate an organism's neural activity to behavior. Neural population analyses often reduce the data dimensionality to focus on relevant activity patterns. A major hurdle to data analysis is spike sorting, and this problem is growing as the number of recorded neurons increases. Here, we investigate whether spike sorting is necessary to estimate neural population dynamics. The theory of random projections suggests that we can accurately estimate the geometry of lowdimensional manifolds from a small number of linear projections of the data. We recorded data using Neuropixels probes in motor cortex of nonhuman primates and reanalyzed data from three previous studies and found that neural dynamics and scientific conclusions are quite similar using multiunit threshold crossings rather than sorted neurons. This finding unlocks existing data for new analyses and informs the design and use of new electrode arrays for laboratory and clinical use.},

  abstract = {Adaptive behavior requires the ability to analyze experience both prospectively and retrospectively. How can forward-ordered neural activity facilitate the storage or expression of reverse-ordered sequences? Wang et al. used multitetrode recordings from many individual hippocampal CA1 neurons in rats while simultaneously recording field potentials expressing theta oscillations. Spatial representation in the place cell network oscillated between forward and backward sweeps within each theta oscillation. Backward replay was associated with theta peaks, whereas forward replay was associated with theta troughs. Most cells fell into one category, but some corresponding to deep-layer neurons showed bimodular responses. Backward replay was driven by entorhinal inputs, whereas forward replay was evoked by CA3 inputs. These are important insights into the underlying basis of coding future and past experiences.Science, this issue p. 247Neural networks display the ability to transform forward-ordered activity patterns into reverse-ordered, retrospective sequences. The mechanisms underlying this transformation remain unknown. We discovered that, during active navigation, rat hippocampal CA1 place cell ensembles are inherently organized to produce independent forward- and reverse-ordered sequences within individual theta oscillations. This finding may provide a circuit-level basis for retrospective evaluation and storage during ongoing behavior. Theta phase procession arose in a minority of place cells, many of which displayed two preferred firing phases in theta oscillations and preferentially participated in reverse replay during subsequent rest. These findings reveal an unexpected aspect of theta-based hippocampal encoding and provide a biological mechanism to support the expression of reverse-ordered sequences.},

Whereas in other brain regions, such as sensory neocortex, the activity of interneurons is often exquisitely stimulus selective and directly determines the responses of neighboring excitatory neurons, the activity of hippocampal interneurons typically lacks the requisite specificity needed to shape the defined structure of principal cell fields. Here we show that hippocampal formation interneurons have ``on'' fields (abrupt increases in activity) and ``off'' fields (abrupt decreases in activity) that are associated with the same location-specific informational content, spatial resolution, and dependency on context as the ``place fields'' of CA1 principal cells. This establishes that interneurons have well-defined place fields, thus having important implications for understanding how the hippocampus represents spatial information.},

Chains of ripples (ripple bursts) in CA1 have been reported to co-occur with long-range place cell sequence replays during the quiet awake state, but roles of neural inputs to CA1 in ripple bursts and replays are unknown. Here we show that ripple bursts in CA1 and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are temporally associated. An inhibition of MECIII input to CA1 during quiet awake reduced ripple bursts in CA1 and restricted the spatial coverage of replays to a shorter distance corresponding to single ripple events. The reduction did not occur with MECIII input inhibition during slowwave sleep. Inhibition of CA3 activity suppressed ripples and replays in CA1 regardless of behavioral state. Thus, MECIII input to CA1 is crucial for ripple bursts and long-range replays specifically in quiet awake, whereas CA3 input is essential for both, regardless of behavioral state.},

This deliberative process, where the pros and cons of each option are considered, relies on memories of past actions and outcomes. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are required for memory encoding, memory retrieval and decision making, but it is unclear how these areas support deliberation. Here we examine the potential neural substrates of these processes in the rat. The rat is a powerful model to investigate the network mechanisms underlying deliberation in the mammalian brain given the anatomical and functional conservation of its hippocampus and prefrontal cortex to other mammalian systems. Importantly, it is amenable to large scale neural recording while performing laboratory tasks that exploit its natural decisionmaking behavior. Focusing on findings in the rat, we discuss how hippocampal-cortical interactions could provide a neural substrate for deliberative decision making.},
