Therefore, uncovering neural representations of hippocampal ensemble spike activity during various behavioral states would provide improved understanding of neural mechanisms of hippocampal-cortical circuits. In this paper, we propose two Bayesian nonparametric methods for this purpose: the Bayesian modeling allows to impose informative priors and constraints into the model, whereas Bayesian nonparametrics allows automatic model selection. We validate these methods to three different hippocampal ensemble recordings under different task behaviors, and provide interpretation and discussion on the derived results.},

  abstract = {In the hippocampus, replay sequences are temporally compressed patterns of neural spiking that resemble patterns that occur when the animal is moving through the environment. Because replay sequences typically occur when the animal is at rest, replay is hypothesized to be part of an internal cognitive process that enables the retrieval of past spatial memories and the planning of future movement. Traditionally, replay sequences have been discovered by identifying sharp wave ripples (SWRs)\textemdash high frequency oscillations that occur in association with replay\textemdash and then looking within SWRs for spatially continuous patterns of neural spiking. This does not fully account for the content or timing of replay sequences, however. Replay sequences do not always co-occur with sharp wave ripples, have more complex dynamics than spatially continuous movement, have different temporal ordering than during movement, and change based on task. In this work, we introduce a hybrid state space framework to describe the richness of replay sequences. We show how defining discrete latent states associated with continuous latent dynamics and point process observations allows us to identify when non-local replay sequences occur, categorize the type of sequence based on their inferred continuous dynamics, and decode the spatial trajectory corresponding to the replay sequence.},

Crucially, animal behavior in natural settings implies that the brain can represent hypothetical future experience not only quickly but also constantly over time, as external events continually unfold. To determine how this is possible, we recorded neural activity in the hippocampus of rats navigating a maze with multiple spatial paths. We found neural activity encoding two possible future scenarios (two upcoming maze paths) in constant alternation at 8 Hz: one scenario per \$125-ms cycle. Further, we found that the underlying dynamics of cycling (both inter- and intra-cycle dynamics) generalized across qualitatively different representational correlates (location and direction). Notably, cycling occurred across moving behaviors, including during running. These findings identify a general dynamic process capable of quickly and continually representing hypothetical experience, including that of multiple possible futures.},

  abstract = {Background: Rodent hippocampal population codes represent important spatial information about the environment during navigation. Computational methods have been developed to uncover the neural representation of spatial topology embedded in rodent hippocampal ensemble spike activity. New method: We extend our previous work and propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to infer rat hippocampal population codes during spatial navigation. To tackle the model selection problem, we leverage a Bayesian nonparametric model. Specifically, we apply a hierarchical Dirichlet processhidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) using two Bayesian inference methods, one based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the other based on variational Bayes (VB).
Results: The effectiveness of our Bayesian approaches is demonstrated on recordings from a freely behaving rat navigating in an open field environment.
Comparison with existing methods: The HDP-HMM outperforms the finite-state HMM in both simulated and experimental data. For HPD-HMM, the MCMC-based inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) hyperparameter sampling is flexible and efficient, and outperforms VB and MCMC approaches with hyperparameters set by empirical Bayes.
Conclusion: The Bayesian nonparametric HDP-HMM method can efficiently perform model selection and identify model parameters, which can used for modeling latent-state neuronal population dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It is thought that only fixed, behaviorally relevant patterns can be reactivated, which are stored across hippocampal synaptic connections. To test whether some generalized rules govern reactivation, we examined trajectory reactivation following non-stereotypical exploration of familiar open-field environments. We found that random trajectories of varying lengths and timescales were reactivated, resembling that of Brownian motion of particles. The animals' behavioral trajectory did not follow Brownian diffusion demonstrating that the exact behavioral experience is not reactivated. Therefore, hippocampal circuits are able to generate random trajectories of any recently active map by following diffusion dynamics. This ability of hippocampal circuits to generate representations of all behavioral outcome combinations, experienced or not, may underlie a wide variety of hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions such as learning, generalization, and planning.},

Neural population analyses often reduce the data dimensionality to focus on relevant activity patterns. A major hurdle to data analysis is spike sorting, and this problem is growing as the number of recorded neurons increases. Here, we investigate whether spike sorting is necessary to estimate neural population dynamics. The theory of random projections suggests that we can accurately estimate the geometry of lowdimensional manifolds from a small number of linear projections of the data. We recorded data using Neuropixels probes in motor cortex of nonhuman primates and reanalyzed data from three previous studies and found that neural dynamics and scientific conclusions are quite similar using multiunit threshold crossings rather than sorted neurons. This finding unlocks existing data for new analyses and informs the design and use of new electrode arrays for laboratory and clinical use.},
